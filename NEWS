    o    overall changes
         - add more comments to code
         - edit main vignette according to comments from reviewers
         - make changes to help according to the changes outlined below, and suggestions from reviewers
    o    changes to icfit
         - allow initfit to be the name of a function used to calculate the initfit
         - make default initfit="initcomputeMLE", using the 'computeMLE' function from the MLEcens package.
           This greatly increases the speed of the algorithm, but the original algorithm is kept.
           Thus, we continue to do the checks on the Kuhn-Tucker conditions on the final estimate
           and the initial fit need not be close to the final NPMLE.
         - speed up each iteration of the EM algorithm by using matrix multiplication instead of
           the apply function.
         - output 'anypzero' as part of icfit objects created in icfit. The value 'anypzero' is  a logical
           to denote if any probability masses where set to zero. In other words, when TRUE
           there are parameters on the boundary of the parameter space and the ad hoc adjustment to the score test
           method is used (as had been used in the previous versions and detailed in the help) when method="scoretest".
         - program restructured. Aintmap function now outside of icfit function
         - if A matrix has 1 column, gives correct values for pf: pf==c(1)
    o    changes to wlr_trafo
         - add method for data.frame so that it may be used easily with the coin package
         - if length of pf=1, gives correct values for scores: all scores=0
    o    changes to ictest
         - add scores="normal" and "general" option, these work only with permutation methods
         - if length of pf=1 from overall fit, gives correct p-value: p.value=1
    o    changed getsurv to properly handle icfit objects that have more than one strata.

        CHANGES in `interval' VERSION 0.7-5.5

    o    comment out extra code in icScoreTest that caused problems in Rcmd check
    o    change first parameter in wlr_trafo to x to remove Rcmd check problems
